            <h3>Hobbies...</h3>

            <p>Daniel’s favorite location is Tibet where he made a mandala with a Buddhist monk. Tibetan mandalas are two or three dimensional ritual objects found in Tibetan Buddhist and other religious traditions. They are supposed to represent the realm of a celestial being, as well as a spiritual journey. The most defining element about them is their symmetry and geometric structure.</p>
            <p>Daniel also enjoys vinyl record collecting. He has a collection worth $60,000.  Vinyl record collecting has been around for a very long time. The first vinyl long-playing record was launched in the 1930's. They went out of fashion once portable CD players came around as well as the iPod and other streaming services. However, in 2008 vinyl sales increased by 89%. Since then vinyl record sales have been increasing as they became a hobby to many enthusiasts all around.</p>
            <p>Daniel also enjoys the singer Mariah Carey and avidly collects every record of hers he can find. He enjoys nature and hiking. He hiked Mount Everest and Mount Fuji in Japan. Mt. Fuji is Japan’s most prominent mountain. The ascent to the summit does not pose any major difficulties although there are some points where there is steep and rocky terrain. The most challenging part about climbing is how the air gets thinner as you go higher. There is some risk of getting altitude sickness as you go higher up and the trip can be long taking between 5-10 hours.</p>
            <p>Finally, Daniel enjoys festivals, photography, and traveling. He spent two years in China where he hiked the five Sacred Mountains of China. He’s taken many photos on his travels to countries such as Japan, Korea, China, Vietnam, Thailand, Tibet, Nepal, India, Mongolia. Europe, the UK, France, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Austria, Czech Republic, Croatia, and Morocco.</p>
